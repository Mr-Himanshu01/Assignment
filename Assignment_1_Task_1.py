# Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
""" This program do the Basic Mathematical Operations like 
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
- Here User have to give inputs of the 2 number on which he wants to do the Mathematical Operations.
- Example : Inputs,
            Enter the first number: x
            Enter the second number: y

            Result,
            Addition: x+y
            Subtraction: x-y
            Multiplication: x*y
            Division: x/y
